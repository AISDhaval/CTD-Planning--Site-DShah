<h2>Discussion</h2>
<h3>Fireworks</h3>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
  <li></li>
  <li>Fireworks has pages and states instead of just layers.</li>
  <li>Built-in web layer.</li>
  <li>Firework's ability to compress images.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Internal Linking</li>
  <li>If you're used to traditional Adobe UIs, like Illustrator or Photoshop, you'll probably be lost, confused and continually frustrated in Fireworks as the menus are very different, keyboard shortcuts are different and things are located in completely different places in the UI.</li>
  <li>Gradient banding: making gradients in Fireworks tend to not blend too well and end up looking banded. The best bet is to make a gradient in Photoshop, then bring it into Fireworks. Strange, I know, but it works.</li>
  <li>It's quirky. Fireworks does random stuff all the time. It's gotten better with CS5, which fixed some 16,000 documented bugs or some insane number, but it still misbehaves from time to time. After a while, you just come to expect the little troublemaker.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dreamweaver</h3>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Code Highlighting</li>
  <li>Code Suggestion</li>
  <li>Code and Design View</li>
  <li>Tabs and Connected files</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Bulky Dynamic Code</li>
  <li>Very Expensive</li>
  <li>Not in full control of Code</li>
  <li>CSS is in the same sheet which may be hard to understand</li>
</ul>
